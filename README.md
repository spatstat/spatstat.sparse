`spatstat.sparse` package.

The package has just been submitted for publication on CRAN,
but is not yet published.

### functionality

The `spatstat.sparse` package

  - defines a class of sparse three-dimensional arrays
    and supports standard operations on them.

  - provides utility functions for matrix computations
    that are common in statistics,
    such as quadratic forms.
